  <p>I watch livestreams a lot on twitch or youtube as second monitor stuff, and most streamers have a chat enabled. Usually, its full of spam, so I don't look at it and its just a blur of words, and I notice only the frequencies, which tends to go up when something interesting happens. This program uses this to find some of the interesting moments from a livestream</p>

  <p>Future TODOs</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fix up LDA as it is currently only a proof of concept, doesn't work too well</li>
    <li>Create a TUI or UI that combines everything in a user friendly way</li>
    <li>Possibly integrate some sort of sentiment analysis to some of the chat messages as an additional metric</li>
  </ul>
