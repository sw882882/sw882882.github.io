  <p>This project is related to Mindustry, an open source game that I used to play quite often. It is a building game, so it has schematics you can save which it does by a custom file format. My plan with this project was to replicate this outside of the game to change it into JSON, which can be handled more easily. I did this as I planned to use this to combine it with generative AI, which could automatically generate schematics</p>
  <p>Note that this project was first started by ASimpleBeginner, but it was abandoned and was only one way (json to schematic), so I forked it.</p>
